# MusicTube

MusicTube is a web application that allows you to extract data from YouTube using Node.js libraries such as Youtube-dl. It provides a user-friendly interface where you can search for videos and lets you play audio only for music purpose

## Goal
Introduced me to working of node.js and express.js with some additional libraries... Remember everything is from **youtube** that is made clear!

## Technologies
MusicTube is built using the following technologies:

**Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code on the server.<br/>
**Express.js:** A web application framework for Node.js that simplifies the development of web applications.<br/>
**Youtube-dl:** A command-line program to download videos from YouTube and extract metadata.<br/>
**HTML5:** The latest version of HTML, which provides the structure and content of the web application.<br/>
**CSS3**: Cascading Style Sheets used for styling the user interface.<br/>
