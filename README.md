# MusicTube

MusicTube is a web application that allows you to extract data from YouTube using Node.js libraries such as Youtube-dl. It provides a user-friendly interface where you can search for videos, create playlists, and play audio tracks directly from YouTube.

## Goal
Introduced me to working of node.js and express.js with some additional libraries... Remember everything is from **youtube** that is made clear!

## Technologies
MusicTube is built using the following technologies:

Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code on the server.<br/>
Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js that simplifies the development of web applications.<br/>
Youtube-dl: A command-line program to download videos from YouTube and extract metadata.<br/>
YouTube Data API: An API provided by YouTube that allows developers to access and interact with YouTube's features programmatically.<br/>
HTML5: The latest version of HTML, which provides the structure and content of the web application.<br/>
CSS3: Cascading Style Sheets used for styling the user interface.<br/>
JavaScript: The programming language used to add interactivity to the application.<br/>
Bootstrap: A popular CSS framework that provides pre-designed components and responsive layouts for building user interfaces.<br/>
